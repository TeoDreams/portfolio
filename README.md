Welcome to the repository for my personal portfolio website, built using **React**! ðŸš€

This project is a dedicated space to showcase my skills, projects, and professional experience. It's a work in progress, and I'm actively developing and refining it.

I'm currently focused on:

* **Core Structure:** Setting up the main components and routing.

# My React Portfolio

Welcome to the repository for my personal portfolio website, built using **React**! üöÄ

This project is a dedicated space to showcase my skills, projects, and professional experience. It's a work in progress, and I'm actively developing and refining it.

---

## Project Status: üöß Under Development

I'm currently focused on:

* **Core Structure:** Setting up the main components and routing (`Home`, `About`, `Projects`, `Contact`).
* **Styling:** Implementing a clean, responsive, and modern design (using **CSS Modules** / **Styled-Components** / *[Specify your styling method here]*).
* **Content Integration:** Populating the sections with up-to-date information and project details.

---

## Technologies Used

* **React:** For building the user interface.
* **Vite** / **Create React App (CRA)**: *[Choose one and specify]* For project scaffolding and development server.
* **React Router DOM:** For navigation within the single-page application (SPA).
* **HTML5** & **CSS3** / **Sass**: For structure and basic styling.
* **JavaScript (ES6+)**: For application logic.
